# Loewner slit

This repository contains the slides for a talk I gave at The University of Washongton at Nov 9, 2010. The talk was based on the following paper.

- *Smoothness of Loewner slits*, Carto Wong, Transactions of the AMS, 366 (2014), 1475 – 1496

The results in this paper are part of my PhD thesis. The paper is also available at [this arXiv page](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5856). The slides are in the file `loewner_slit_slides.pdf` in this repository. Below is the abstract of the paper.

###  Abstract
In this paper, we show that the chordal Loewner differential equation with C<sup>β</sup> driving function generates a C<sup>β + 1/2</sup> slit for 1/2 < β ≤ 2, except when β = 3/2 the slit is only proved to be weakly C<sup>1, 1</sup>.
